most websites have login pages and in

this video i'm going to show you how to

hack them so why target login pages well

behind every login page is access to

confidential information or even

administrator level access this is gold

dust for hackers and as penetration

testers or bug bounty hunters it's

extremely valuable for us as well so how

do we actually go about hacking a login

page well there are two main types of

attack that we can use here

brute forcing and dictionary attacks a

brute force attack is where you try

every possible password that exists for

example we might start a

then a a then aaa then aab and so on and

so forth until the correct password is

found now in theory this will eventually

find the correct password no matter what

it is

however the time it can take can vary

greatly for example if you're finding a

5 character password with only lowercase

letters this could take seconds a 16

character password with numbers

uppercase and special characters however

could take millions of years now i don't

know about you but i don't have the

patience to wait millions of years

this is why we use the second type of

attack called a dictionary attack a

dictionary attack is actually a type of

brute force

but instead of trying every single

possible combination of letters numbers

and symbols we use pre-built lists of

possible passwords

you see us humans are not as smart as we

think we are we tend to use passwords

that are easy to type easy to remember

and even reuse the same password over

and over again

and as clever as you think you're being

unless your password is truly unique

it's likely to have been used many times

before so we can use lists of passwords

containing words phrases and known

passwords from past data breaches and

there is a good chance that we will find

a match

luckily we don't need to type these

passwords ourselves there are plenty of

tools that can do this for us and

probably the most popular is one called

hydra hydra is a free tool used to hack

logins and is what we're going to be

using today

so now let's move on to the hacking

we're going to need a hacking machine

such as kali linux or paraos and we're

also going to need a test website with a

login page for us to hack

now you can set this up yourself with

virtual machines and installing web

servers but luckily our sponsor for

today's video has us covered hack the

box academy provides real hands-on

training with browser-based hacking

environments nothing to download or

install and ready to go in minutes they

have tons of great training available

including this one called login brute

forcing this module is part of their

certified bug bounty hunter training

this training path will take you from

almost zero to hacking into websites in

no time at all

so i'm going to be using the hackthebox

academy environment to show you how this

all works if you want to follow along

use the link below in the description to

sign up

so here is our attacker's machine and

here is the website login that we're

going to hack

as you can see it's a pretty standard

username and password page

now we have our target let's see how we

can use hydra to find some credentials

now our attacking machine is running

parrot os from hack the box academy and

it has hydra pre-installed

if you're running kali linux you should

also have it

if you're using anything else you may

need to install it using apt or download

it from the official github

so let's look at the command format

there are a few bits of information here

so let's break this down

hydra is a really powerful tool with

many different options

this is the general format of the

command that we need for this attack

hydra specifies the tool

dash l login or dash l file is the

section that we tell hydra what to put

into the username field we can use a

lowercase l and specify a user account

manually or we can use an uppercase l

and use a list of usernames

dash p pass or dash p file

is the section very similar to the last

one but it tells hydra what to put into

the password field

using a lowercase p

tells us to specify the password

and the uppercase p will use a password

list

dash u this will try every username for

each password if we have a small

username list and a large password list

this could dramatically reduce the time

it takes to find the correct password

f is pretty simple it tells hydra to

stop trying to find passwords once the

first match is found we then need to add

the ip address or the domain name of the

target website dash s to specify the

port number of the target website and

the module section tells hydra which

modules to use now a module is a service

to attack

some module examples are http

remote desktop protocol ssh and many

many more

this last part depends on the module you

select this example shows typical

options for http attack which is what

we're going to be doing today

okay so now we have the basis of our

command let's start writing this out so

first i'm going to open a terminal

i'll make this a little bit bigger so we

can see

move this over here

and we're first going to start with sudo

because we want to run with elevated

permissions

then we type

hydra

and now we need to choose either a

specific username to try to attack or a

list of possible usernames

now a lot of the time you won't know

anything about the target nor do we have

any known usernames a good guess is

there will be something like admin

administrator or something along those

lines so we could try our luck choosing

the username ourselves but we may be

better off using a list of common

usernames

there are lots of word lists available

with common usernames

a great place for this is seclists which

has a ton of great word lists

it's already pre-installed in our hack

the box academy machine but you can

download it from their github so to tell

hydra we want to use a list of usernames

we use the command dash

capital l

and then the location of our word list

in our example we'll use the word list

located in

opt

useful

set lists

usernames

and it's called

top username shortlist

this word list contains some of the most

common usernames

next we need to tell hydra which

passwords to try

again there are tons of password lists

out there one popular list is the roku

password list from a massive data breach

back in 2009

this contains over 14 million passwords

ranging from very simple to more complex

passwords

to use this list we need to type dash

capital p

and then the location of our list which

for me is

opt

useful

set lists

passwords

leak databases and then

dot rockyou.

now if you're not using hack the box

academy then your list may be somewhere

else or you may need to download it

then we type dash u to tell hydra to try

every username from our small user list

for each password

this is rather than 14 million passwords

for each username

now we use the dash f

to tell hydra to stop looking once a

match has been found

now if you're trying to find as many

credentials as possible then you may not

want to add this bit

now we need to add our target ip address

or domain name and the port number

in our example our ip address is here

and we'll copy that

paste it

s for the port number and as we can see

it's

just here

copy

and we'll paste that as well

perfect

now this last part will need a bit more

explaining this is the module section

where we tell hydra what type of logging

we're trying to attack so it knows which

techniques to use

web logins like this are the http post

form module

so we type

http

dash

post dash

form

and this will select that module then we

need to add some parameters and we'll

open that with some quotation marks

the first parameter is the url of the

login page itself and we can see up here

at the top it's

login.php

so we'll start with

login.php

then we just need to add a colon to

separate the parameters

next we need to tell hydra where to

input the username and where to input

the password to do this we need to find

out the names of these fields now there

are a few ways to do this but one of the

easiest ways is to open a program called

burp suite

now to do that we go up to applications

and i'll go to pen testing

most use tools and there it is that burp

suite

click onto there

a couple of prompts will come up just

skip past those

accept

close

temporary project is fine for this

use the defaults start burp

burp suite has tons of great website

hacking tools but the main one and the

one we're interested in today is the

proxy at the top so proxy here

using the proxy allows us to inspect all

requests that are being sent to the web

server

before we can use the proxy though we

need to add the settings in our browser

to do this we'll just go back to firefox

select the menu go to preferences

then at the top right we'll just type

proxy

and where it says network settings click

settings

and manual

proxy configuration

and we're just going to use http for

this and in the address we'll type

127.0.0.1

and the default port number for burp

suite is 80

80.

click ok

and that's that saved

what this does is tell our browser to

send all of the web requests to our

proxy where we can then view and even

change them if we wanted to before

they're sent to the web server

so now we're set up we just need to

enter some test credentials and we

should be able to see the form input

names

so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

click on to user

i'm just going to type test

and for the password again i'm going to

hit test

now when i click login

nothing will happen it will kind of hang

here nothing happens but if we go over

to burp suite you'll see

this is the request being sent to the

web server

at the bottom we can see our test

credentials and most importantly we can

see the login parameter names

so we have username

and simply password

and we can use these for our hydra

command

so let's go back to our terminal

we'll type in username

and the tell hydra that this is where

they input the user

will go equals

up arrow

user

up arrow

then we do the same for the password

field by typing

and to separate them

password

equals and this is where to input the

pass

information

perfect now the last bit we need to do

is tell hydra when to know when a

username and password is correct

if you think about it hydra won't know

what a successful login looks like right

so we need to tell it

this is the part that people tend to

forget so what we need to do is add

another parameter to tell hydra when to

stop trying passwords

now because we don't know what a

successful login looks like meaning we

don't know what happens when it logs in

we need to use something that we're

pretty sure won't be there once we do

log in

it's pretty reasonable to think that

once we log in

that this login page won't be there now

if you think about it there won't be any

need for a login page once you've

already logged in right

so let's find the name of this login

form

to do that we'll just press f12 on the

keyboard to bring up the developer tools

select the inspection tool

and we can just move our mouse around

until we select that form

so select that there

and we can read through here we can see

the name of the form is called login

so we use that to tell hydra hey if you

no longer see this login form then

that's a pretty good chance that that's

a successful login

so to do that we move over to our

terminal

again we do a colon to separate the

parameters

then we need to do

capital f for failure

equals

and to say what a failure looks like

i'll add the name of our form which is

open bracket

form

name

equals

login

we then need to close our module

parameters with quotation marks

so we now have the username list the

password list

the ip address the port number and our

module options

when we press enter hydra will start

trying lots of different passwords until

a match is found

so i'll press enter

and of course i get an error and that is

because the login page should start with

a forward slash

so the command should now look like this

press enter

and hydra will start to try lots of

different passwords

as we can see very quickly we receive a

match the login name is admin and the

password is the very secure password of

password one

now this just shows how quickly we can

crack

simple passwords now in the real world

if this was a little bit more complex

this will probably take a little bit

more time

so we can confirm this works just by

going back to our login page

typing the username as admin

and the password is

password1

and not forgetting to turn our proxy

server off we can just turn this

interception is on button off

and that's removed our name so again

we'll go admin

password one

hit the login button

as you can see we have successfully

logged in and the text you see here is

actually some clues for our next hack

the box challenge

down at the bottom we also have a flag

to complete this section

so we've just hacked a website login now

it's worth noting that most sites we use

today like facebook instagram etc will

have account lockouts this means that

after a few tries you'll be locked out

of your account for a set period of time

this dramatically reduces the

effectiveness of these attacks because

you can't try lots and lots of passwords

all at once

now a great way to make sure that your

accounts are protected against these

types of attacks is to make sure you

enable multi-factor authentication this

way even if an attacker does get your

login credentials they still need that

second factor which is usually a code on

your mobile

so that is how we can force our way into

website login forms using hydra hydra is

a great tool and it can even be used to

brute force services such as ftp and ssh

if you like this video you will really

love the module on hack to box academy

they cover everything i just did and

much much more so go check it out in the

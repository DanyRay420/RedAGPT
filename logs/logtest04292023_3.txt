Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.
Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
If you have completed all your tasks, make sure to use the "finish" command.

GOALS:

1. 
            Use the hydra command to scan the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/ `hydra -L /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/username_list.txt -P /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/password_list.txt -s PORT HOSTNAME http-post-form -o /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/logs/hydra_log.txt "/admin/login/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid username or password"
            
2. 
            Using selenium python package and its WebDriver API, create a python program that iterates through the username list /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/username_list.txt with every password  at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/password_list.txt and try to login at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/ and store the python program at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/bin
            
3. 
            Create a natural English language security report for those who 
            are not technically savy to read. Include details of methods used and results found
            - Include a summery at the end of the report detailing what was wrong and how to fix issues.
            - If there are no issues found, return "No Security Issues Reported"
            
4. Keep logs and the final security report at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/logs/


Constraints:
1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
3. No user assistance
4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"

Commands:
1. search: 
                Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. 
                You should ask targeted questions
                , args json schema: {"tool_input": {"type": "string"}}
2. Python REPL: A Python shell. Use this to execute python commands. Input should be a valid python command. If you want to see the output of a value, you should print it out with `print(...)`., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
3. bash: useful for when you want to run a command in the bash terminal., args json schema: {"tool_input": {"type": "string"}}
4. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
5. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
6. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"

Resources:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
2. Long Term memory management.
3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
4. File output.

Performance Evaluation:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.

2. 
            Using selenium python package and its WebDriver API, create a python program that iterates through the username list /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/username_list.txt with every password  at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/password_list.txt and try to login at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/ and store the python program at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/bin
            
3. 
            Create a natural English language security report for those who 
            are not technically savy to read. Include details of methods used and results found
            - Include a summery at the end of the report detailing what was wrong and how to fix issues.
            - If there are no issues found, return "No Security Issues Reported"
            
4. Keep logs and the final security report at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/logs/


Constraints:
1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
3. No user assistance
4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"

Commands:
1. search: 
                Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. 
                You should ask targeted questions
                , args json schema: {"tool_input": {"type": "string"}}
2. Python REPL: A Python shell. Use this to execute python commands. Input should be a valid python command. If you want to see the output of a value, you should print it out with `print(...)`., args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
3. bash: useful for when you want to run a command in the bash terminal., args json schema: {"tool_input": {"type": "string"}}
4. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}, "append": {"title": "Append", "description": "Whether to append to an existing file.", "default": false, "type": "boolean"}}
5. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
6. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"

Resources:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
2. Long Term memory management.
3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
4. File output.

Performance Evaluation:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.

GOALS:

1. 
            Use the hydra command to scan the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/ `hydra -L /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/username_list.txt -P /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/password_list.txt -s PORT HOSTNAME http-post-form -o /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/logs/hydra_log.txt "/admin/login/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid username or password"
            
2. 
            Using selenium python package and its WebDriver API, create a python program that iterates through the username list /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/username_list.txt with every password  at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/data/password_list.txt and try to login at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/ and store the python program at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/bin
            
3. 
            Create a natural English language security report for those who 
            are not technically savy to read. Include details of methods used and results found
            - Include a summery at the end of the report detailing what was wrong and how to fix issues.
            - If there are no issues found, return "No Security Issues Reported"
            
4. Keep logs and the final security report at /home/host/Project/Python/RedAGPT/RedAGPT/tools/logs/
